JoomExBuild is a Joomla Extension Build Script to run under the phing scripting language. 
It consists of two parts:
- "update_repo" which updates a repository (or just a holding folder) from a Joomla! installation or test server with the files that make up that chosen extension.
- "build_package" that takes those files and creates an installable package from them.

See "Joomla Build Script readme.pdf" for full documentation.

Although not a fork, this project has been based on the code and ideas to be found here: https://github.com/rvsjoen/joomla-helloworld
